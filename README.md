## Roadmap

- [ ] Finetune/train and evaluate a model that does IPA transcription with timestamps for English
- [ ] Curate a small evaluation dataset to inform prompt engineering and LLM choice. This will include a handful of common speech phenomena to ensure the model can explain the relevant tongue positioning etc.
- [ ] Create and iterate on an LLM pipeline to provide feedback to the user
- [ ] Create/license visuals/animations for each phoneme (there are less than 40 relevant for English) and curate a database of common words in different languages that can be used to explain English sounds to their native speakers
- [ ] Create a desktop application that allows users to practice audio clips from their favorite shows (see the [Figma demo](https://www.figma.com/proto/VPHimCfONGurh0s07IKova/Mozilla_Pitch?node-id=2-187&t=slW83co4vzXQNPGt-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1))
- [ ] Support more languages for learning
- [ ] Expand the number of available audio sources (e.g. audio books from LibriVox)
- [ ] Recommendation system that recommends movies/shows that are appropriate to the learners language level
